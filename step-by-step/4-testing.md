## Testing Your Alexa Skill

So far, we have [created a Voice User Interface](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-node-device-address-api/blob/master/step-by-step/1-voice-user-interface.md) and [a Lambda function](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-node-device-address-api/blob/master/step-by-step/2-lambda-function.md), and [connected the two together](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-node-device-address-api/blob/master/step-by-step/3-connect-vui-to-lambda.md).  Your skill is now ready to test.

1.  **Go back to the [Amazon Developer Portal](https://developer.amazon.com/edw/home.html#/skills/list) and select your skill from the list.** You may still have a browser tab open if you started at the beginning of this tutorial.

2.  **Open the "Test" tab on the left side.**

3.  **Understand the voice simulator.** While it's not specific to your skill, the Voice Simulator is a valuable testing tool for every skill. Type a word into the box, and click the "Listen" button to hear how Alexa will
pronounce it. To make changes to her pronunciation, use Speech Synthesis Markup Language [(SSML)](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/speech-synthesis-markup-language-ssml-reference) to modify how Alexa will interpret text to speech. Try these examples:

    ```html
    <say-as interpret-as="number">12345</say-as>
    ```

    ```html
    <say-as interpret-as="ordinal">12345</say-as>
    ```

    ```html
    <say-as interpret-as="digits">12345</say-as>
    ```

    <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/mobile-apps/dex/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/tutorials/quiz-game/4-3-voice-simulator._TTH_.png" />

    Return to the Voice Simulator as needed to ensure that Alexa says words and phrases as you would expect.

4.  **Test with a device.** The Service Simulator is not a device, so it cannot be used to test the device address component of your skill workflow. Use a an actual device for testing and development when testing Device Address API. [See Test the Device Address API](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/device-address-api#test-the-device-address-api-as-you-develop-your-skill).
5. **Learn more about how the API works** The [Using the Device Address API](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/device-address-api#test-the-device-address-api-as-you-develop-your-skill) walks you through getting user permission, the consent token and device id, details on all the responses, testing, and fallback strategies
